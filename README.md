## Implementation Details.
According to [The epistle to the Implementors](http://brainfuck.org/epistle.html), there are some specific topics to consider before doing an implementation of the language. In our implementation we follow some of them. Here is the list:


- When the value of a cell is 10, it means end-of-line.
- When found an EOF, it does not affect anything.
- The supported character set of operators is { '+', ',', '-', '.', '<', '>', '[', ']' }. Any other character is a comment.
- The input must be a valid utf-8 encoded file.
- The default size of the slice is 32767 cells.
- The pointer starts at position 0 of the slice.
- Output is not necessarily done with a monospace font. It will depend on the local context.
- I/O operations are done during execution, so all programs are interactive.
- The input operation has a default, yet configurable prompt.
- The compiler matches [] before execution, and it will report an error with unbalanced [].
- The interpreter have some configurable features like: prompt, and slice size.
- The interpreter does not work with negative pointers. (too much? ü§î)
- The interpreter will wrap around individual cells.
- Peace be with all implementors.


The interpreter is intended to be used as a package to embed in any Go project. It exports two configurable global parameters (tape size and promtp), and the function `Run(code string)`. The interpreter is thread safe, and does not produce any data races. 


Nobody knows when is needed a concurrent safe [brainf**k](http://brainfuck.org/) interpreter written in [Go](https://go.dev/).
